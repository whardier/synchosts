# SyncHosts (Python)

This project helps synchronize `/etc/hosts` (and friends) in a configurable and pluggable way.

## Motivation

Using split DNS, magical DNS servers, and dealing with DNS hijacking while working remotely can be a painful experience.

When you simply need to resolve hostnames to a simple address you can take advantage of `/etc/hosts` or even a local DNS service.  In time this can become a cumbersome process and difficult to share with the rest of the team.
